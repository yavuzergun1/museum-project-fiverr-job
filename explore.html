          The aim of our museum is to create a space where everyone can
          experience the wonders of our discoveries and perhaps even ignite a
          lifelong passion to continue the exploration of the world around us.
          <br /><br />
          We believe science should not be confined to the textbook, but brought
          to live through exhibits. This is why we have over 1000 different
          exhibits on the many varied subjects of science to explore. Many of
          these exhibits are designed for you to interact with and play around
          to see science come to life (apart from the dinosaur exhibits - they
          only come to life at night when everyone's gone home).

              As a community-driven museum, we want to work with schools to
              create places of learning and exploring. Our team are on hand to
              give your students guided tours of the museum, teach them in our
              learning laboratory, and provide great video presentations that
              will excite and inspire them.
              <br /><br />
              Please get in touch with us here to find out more about our
              facilities and to arrange a time to bring your students through
              for a visit.

              Are you a young person looking to learn more about science? Come
              on down to our museum, there’s plenty to see and do. You can learn
              about Newtonian physics from our bumper swing, or why not travel
              back in time and meet our resident Woolly Mammoth? Our exhibits
              are designed to be accessible for interested minds, so make sure
              you come ready to learn and explore. <br />
              We also have the Young Stars club which meets once a week on a
              Saturday between 10:00 and 13:00 where you’ll get to explore and
              experiment with our team of experts. <br />
              During the school holidays we run special holiday clubs where you
              can join other children your age to go on a journey of discovery.
              Each holiday we pick a new theme to explore. To find out more
              about the holiday club and how you can join, send us a message.
